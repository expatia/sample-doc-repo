# How We Use LinkedIn

This section describes how we use the LinkedIn platform to help achieve the goals set out in the [Content](./README.md) section of this document set.

The LinkedIn platform is suitable as a means of engaging our customers and sales prospects in a more thoughtful and helpful way. We use our social media platform to:

* advertize our products
* educate users about our products
* engage with our users to build brand loyalty
* engage with our users to build a community around our products and services


## Relevance to Software Architecture

We build our software to integrate with our various content channels. We use our content channels to drive sales prospects into our software so we can:

* educate sales prospects about the value of our software
* demonstrate our software products quickly, cheaply but more importantly effectively
* convert sales prospects into paying customers
* retain existing customers by educating them about the new features of our software products and building a greater appreciation of existing features.


## Suitable Content for our LinkedIn Presence

Posts on LinkedIn are an excellent means of describing particular use cases for our software products that show our products in their best light.

* Existing Features
* New features
* Case studies
* The improvements we are making

We are then able to use the LinkedIn knowledge graph to better engage with the customers in our target market.
