## Relevance to Software Architecture

* educate sales prospects about the value of our software
* demonstrate our software products quickly, cheaply but more importantly effectively
* convert sales prospects into paying customers
* retain existing customers by educating them about the new features of our software products and building a greater appreciation of existing features.


## Suitable Content for our Blogs

* Existing Features
* New features
