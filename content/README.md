# Content Management

This section of the documentation describes how we use online content to:

* advertise our products in an effective SEO-friendly manner
* create opportunities for building commercial relationships with our strategic business partners
* educate existing, new and potential customers about our products
* promote the unique value of our products versus those of our competitors
* convert leads into sales more effectively
* provide online help
* provide convenient and contextually relevant links into particular areas of functionality provided by our software products and platform.


We invest in content in order to drive progress towards our business gloals. How we do this is described in more detail in our [Digital Marketing Strategy](./digital-marketing-strategy.md).


Furthermore, content may be used to broaden the appeal of our software beyond English-speakers though [internationalization](./internationalization/README.md). And [Business Content](./business-content/README.md) may be published on a scheduled or unscheduled basis and available through our software to inform our customers of important changes that they should be aware of (as well as any other useful information that our customers may otherwise remain unaware of).
