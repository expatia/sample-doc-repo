# General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)

The General Data Protection Regulation, abbreviated GDPR, is a European Union regulation on information privacy in the European Union and the European Economic Area. This is often adopted by companies and organizations outside of the European Union (for example, in the United States, Australia, the United Kingdom, Canada and elsewhere) as best practice and in order to future-proof regulatory compliance in markets beyond the domestic market of that country.

This document and other documents in this section of the documentation sets out Compass data protection policies and how, if at all, these align with GDPR.
