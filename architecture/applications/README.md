# Application Architecture

The product suite contains multiple applications. We add applications to the application suite and platform over time. 

Although each application builds upon the same underlying platform and technology stack, each application is independently maintained and evolved. The software architecture of each application is therefore unique and has its own software architecture documentation.

An overview of each software application is shown below. To view the application-specific software archicture documention, click on the relevant links.
